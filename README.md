# Understanding and Addressing Employee Turnover
## Leveraging Data-Driven Insights to Enhance Employee Retention and Reduce Attrition
### Issue:
The company has been experiencing higher-than-expected employee turnover rates, leading to increased recruitment costs and reduced organizational efficiency. Understanding the drivers of employee attrition is critical for developing strategies that improve retention and overall workplace satisfaction.
### Response:
To address this challenge, a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and drivers of employee turnover, then a machine learning predictive model was developed using employee data to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover. By understanding these patterns, the company can proactively intervene to retain valuable talent, improve job satisfaction, and reduce turnover.
### Impact:
Implementing the predictive model will enable the company to:
- Identify at-risk employees and intervene early.
- Tailor retention strategies to the specific needs of different employee segments.
- Optimize resource allocation in HR efforts, reducing the costs associated with high turnover rates.
